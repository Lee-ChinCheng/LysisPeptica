# LysisPeptica
A docker for therapeutic peptides, hemolysis risk prediction. The pipeline includes selectable hemolysis% threshold for prediction 5, 10, 20 or 30. Default is 10.

### Main Goal
Therapeutic Peptides or Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with high hemolysis risk are unsuitable as drugs, but experimental validation is costly. Our model enables early in silico screening to filter out hemolytic candidates.
